        <ol>
            <li>
                How long can the localStorage object store the key-value pairs in it? As I understand probably it is until the 
                cached files are deleted from the browser's memory. Is it right? And the only way of storing this information longer 
                is only by using SQL or NOSQL databases? Right?
